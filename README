NAME
    Message::Passing::STOMP - input and output messages to STOMP.

SYNOPSIS
        # Terminal 1:
        $ message-pass --input STDIN --output STOMP --output_options \
            '{"destination":"/queue/foo","hostname":"localhost","port":"6163","username":"guest","password":"guest"}'
        {"data":{"some":"data"},"@metadata":"value"}

        # Terminal 2:
        $ message-pass --output STDOUT --input STOMP --input_options \
            '{"destination":"/queue/foo","hostname":"localhost","port":"6163","username":"guest","password":"guest"}'
        {"data":{"some":"data"},"@metadata":"value"}

DESCRIPTION
    An STOMP <http://stomp.github.com/> transport for Message::Passing.

    STOMP <http://stomp.github.com/> is a simple and well supported
    messaging protocol, with clients in many languages.

    This is a simple adaptor to allow you to send or receive STOMP messages

QUEUES AND TOPICS
    STOMP does not specify the semantics for message destinations or
    subscriptions (other than that they are a string), however most common
    STOMP servers (including ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ) expect a string matching
    /queue/name or /topic/name.

    Messages published to a destination prefixed by /queue/ are queued up,
    until a subscriber connects, at which point they are delivered. If
    multiple subscribers connect then the messages are distributed between
    the subscribers (i.e. each subscriber sees a portion of the messages).

    Messages published to a destination prefixed by /topic/ are copied to
    all connected subscribers, however if there are no subscribers
    currently, they are discarded, rather than being queued up.

STOMP SERVERS
    There are a number of message brokers which will communicate with STOMP
    clients, the main ones being:

  RabbitMQ
    RabbitMQ <http://www.rabbitmq.com/> has a STOMP plugin
    <http://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html>.

  ActiveMQ
    ActiveMQ <http://activemq.apache.org/> has a STOMP plugin
    <http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html>.
